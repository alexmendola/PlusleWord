## Overview

PlusleWord is a fun, Pokémon-themed word game inspired by PlusWord and Wordle. Players will need to guess Pokémon-related 5-letter words based on clues. Each guess will provide feedback in the form of color-coded boxes (similar to Wordle).

## How to Play

- Each clue has a 5-letter answer that is Pokémon-themed.
- After each guess, feedback is provided:
  - Green: Correct letter, correct position.
  - Yellow: Correct letter, wrong position.
  - White: Incorrect letter.
- The game ends once all words are guessed or the user runs out of attempts.
